## Introduction

Provide a brief introduction to your deep learning framework. Explain what it is, why it was created, and what makes it unique.

## Features

Highlight the key features of your framework. For example:

- Easy-to-use API
- Support for multiple neural network architectures
- GPU acceleration
- Automatic differentiation
- Model serialization and deserialization
- Extensive documentation and tutorials

## Installation

Provide instructions on how to install your framework. Include different methods such as using pip, cloning the repository, or installing from source.

### From Source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pyon0303/dezero.git
cd dezero
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

### Quick Start
Quick Start
Provide a quick start guide to help users get up and running with your framework. Include a simple example of how to create, train, and evaluate a neural network.

```python
import your_framework as yf

# Define a simple neural network
model = yf.Sequential([
    yf.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    yf.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    yf.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f'Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

### Examples
Provide links to example projects or notebooks that demonstrate the capabilities of your framework.
Example 1: Image Classification
Example 2: Text Generation
